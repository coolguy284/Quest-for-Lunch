Fix FBX file:
	Remove Idle (1)
	Add Crouch-Start to compliment Crouch-Release
	Add an animation called "A" or something that has a "default" pose so when it is displayed it is obvious that an animation is not playing (an animation should be playing at all times)

Todo anim.: 
	- All 9 Weapons

Finished anim: 
	- Idle
	- Run
	- Rising-Air
	- Falling-Air
	- Crouch
	- Crouch (Release)
	- Landing
	- Damaged-Intial
	- Damaged-Final
	- Death
	- Wallclimb
	- Wallcling
	- Dodge
	- Ledge Grab
