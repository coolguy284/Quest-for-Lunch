slightly reduce endlag on bow
soften speed cap so less jitter
slight input lag on top of platform, basically extend the lag when going up through a platform to a little bit after it as well

wall to ground getup animation
chance that enemy is stunned on hit is enemy base stun chance plus stun chance of weapon
add teleport attack
sword is melee, fork is ranged (for now)
save player data

things on the weapons (stats), abilities
secondary currency for extra abilities
animations for stuff
make rendering and 3d rendering pixel perfect
potential upscaling to combat 3d texture jitteryness, can just upscale the entity cam to a render texture

bugs:
if quality low, movement speed crazy and jumps all over the place, jumps, everything basically 5.0x speed
double jump gone when regular jump if game lags enough

keep in mind:
should be able to hold left click on bow for quickfire bows
