add teleport attack
sword is melee, fork is ranged (for now)
save player data

things on the weapons (stats), abilities
secondary currency for extra abilities
add 3d model with animations
make rendering and 3d rendering pixel perfect
potential upscaling to combat 3d texture jitteryness, can just upscale the entity cam to a render texture

bugs:
if quality low, movement speed crazy and jumps all over the place, jumps, everything basically 5.0x speed
double jump gone when regular jump if game lags enough

keep in mind:
should be able to hold left click on bow for quickfire bows
