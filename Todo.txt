kickback force when stop holding direction to stop motion, on ground and air
fastfalling should not happen when right above platform, this prevents accidental fastfall and end lag, instead should immediately go to drop thru platform state
much bigger wallclinglag, 0.7s
arrows should hit ground much sooner, only slightly offscreen
gravity on arrow starts at 0 and increases quickly at end of arrow range
should be albe to hold left click on bow for quickfire bows
slightly reduce endlag on bow
should not be able to do any input in platform, no attacks or anything, it should cancel attacks that are halfway and also wallcling state
when a weapon is used, do a halfhearted stop instead of a full and complete stop
soften speed cap so less jitter
slight input lag on top of platform, basically extend the lag when going up through a platform to a little bit after it as well
make wallclingstate and other halt states actually halt by changing rigibody to kinematic or something

chance that enemy is stunned on hit is enemy base stun chance plus stun chance of weapon
add teleport attack
sword is melee, fork is ranged (for now)
save player data

things on the weapons (stats), abilities
secondary currency for extra abilities
animations for stuff
make rendering and 3d rendering pixel perfect
potential upscaling to combat 3d texture jitteryness, can just upscale the entity cam to a render texture

bugs:
if quality low, movement speed crazy and jumps all over the place, jumps, everything basically 5.0x speed
double jump gone when regular jump if game lags enough
