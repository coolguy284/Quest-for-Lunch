platform pull up on the edge of a platform should trigger a ledge get up
add crouching
add health bar above enemy

add teleport attack
things on the weapons (stats), abilities
secondary currency for extra abilities
seperate animation controller for model vs player
make rendering and 3d rendering pixel perfect
potential upscaling to combat 3d texture jitteryness, can just upscale the entity cam to a render texture
save player data

bugs:
if quality low, movement speed crazy and jumps all over the place, jumps, everything basically 5.0x speed
double jump gone when regular jump if game lags enough

keep in mind:
should be able to hold left click on bow for quickfire bows
